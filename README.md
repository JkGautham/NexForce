# Height and Weight Analysis

Welcome to the repository for analyzing height and weight data from the "SOCR-HeightWeight.csv" dataset. This Python script computes and displays statistical measures such as mean, median, and mode for both height and weight.

## Data:

The dataset used in this analysis, "SOCR-HeightWeight.csv," contains information on height and weight.

## Code Overview:

The provided Python script calculates the mean, median, and mode for both height and weight using the statistics module. It reads the data from the CSV file and stores the height and weight values in separate lists. Users can interactively choose which statistical measure to compute and can exit the program by entering 'N' or 'n'.

## Functions:

### Mean:

- Computes the mean height and mean weight in inches and pounds, respectively.

### Mode:

- Determines the mode height and mode weight in inches and pounds, respectively.

### Median:

- Calculates the median height and median weight in inches and pounds, respectively.

## Usage:

Run the script, and it will prompt you to choose a statistical measure (mean, median, mode) for either height or weight. Enter 'N' or 'n' to exit the program.

## Dataset Source:

The dataset used for this analysis is located at '/content/drive/MyDrive/DataSet/SOCR-HeightWeight.csv'.

Feel free to explore the script and adapt it for your analysis needs.

Happy analyzing!
